Update from Yair - we failed (again) to get mosad mitnadev. 
Need to check why, maybe contest, get 33% for beit melacha
Bank status: ~36750NIS
Paypal:1050 ( 600 of which for the Soldering for beginners)
Bitcoin wallet - to check who has it.
From last meeting:
Jonathan to write email to publicise the workshops, Ronen will send them via mailchimp

Ronen - discourse, maybe we can use a solution (e.g. amazon) to send unlimited amounts of emails. 
Landing page - Jossef working on it, will be the initial version for TAMI review.
David - Kitchen workshop still working on it, I want to finish the knife 1st , need to check how much of the process I will outsource
Asaf’s soldering workshop launched - we need to send email about it.  
Movie night - we need to reach a consensus regarding how to operate it.

Events - things are all on Shay, WE NEED A VOLUNTEER dedicated for it!

Asaf - there’s lots of room to streamline the stations positioning in TAMI
Stations not well positions, e.g. electronics - we have 3 partially functioning stations. 
Nothing is properly sorted.
I checked a few things. Since I am starting to study in Shenkar soon. 
I want to create and manage the electronics components library
I have a general idea how much it is going to cost.  Next week I will make a BOM with cost estimates. 

Also we have all sorts of missing tools - 
I will make a tool list

Asaf - I have an idea for an arduino desk ( add to wekan)

Makeathon this weekend :  Ronen - I want to make the door sensor, I may require help to update Telegram
Another useful thing is to create a reminder at the door for people who enter so that they can say for how long they are staying. 

Jonathan: Phone - we need to verify it works continuously. Last time we checked it didn’t . Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn’t. 

Ronen - remove the option to leave messages. Will be done. 

End of meeting.
